# Design and Operation of a Simple Solar Inverter

A solar inverter is a pivotal component in solar power systems, responsible for converting Direct Current (DC) from solar panels or batteries into Alternating Current (AC) that can power household appliances. This guide offers a detailed, step-by-step approach to constructing a simple solar inverter, making it an excellent resource for learners, hobbyists, and educators.

The inverter design is divided into three key sections:

1. Oscillation: Produces a stable AC signal at a frequency of 50 to 60 Hz.
2. Amplification: Boosts the signal’s power to drive larger loads.
3. Step-Up Transformation: Converts low-voltage AC into a high-voltage AC
suitable for appliances.

## Learning Objective 

+ Introduction to electronics and electronic components.
+ Introduction to solar inverters: what they are and how they are used
+ (Use of a digital multimeter: how to test electronic components) __--> not part of the document! is there any other resource we coud use? like a youtube video or some guide?__
+ Solar inverter design: How to build your own DIY solar inverter

## Training schedule 
### Day 1
+ Day 1 started with an introduction, the trainees introduced themselves and their interests as well as staff.
+ The participants were briefed about the purpose of the training and the participants were asked to write down their expectations.
+ The participants were introduced to basic tools for repair and were taken through the various types of mobile phones and its parts. 
+ The 16 women trainees were then grouped into 3 groups, each consisting of 5 members and discussed topics such as common mobile phone faults, procedures to consider when doing a repair and steps in troubleshooting and soldering a device. They were given questions to discussed 

### Day 2
+ A check-in and recap session was conducted to evaluate the level of understanding of the participants about what they have learnt on day one.
+ The students were introduced to what a solar inverter is and how to use a digital multimeter to test electronic components.
+ They were also taken through the steps in designing and building a DIY solar inverter from electronics waste.
Using sticky notes, the students were asked to give feedback about the training.


## The CIC Solar Inverter

The project's brief documentation is available to view. This film shows how the inverter was assembled and how it is working.
