## Amplification Section

The signal from the oscillation section has limited power and cannot directly drive a load. The amplification section uses MOSFETs (IRFZ44N) to amplify the signalâ€™s current and voltage, making it suitable for powering larger devices.

### Step-by-Step Wiring

1. Install MOSFETs:
    + Place the two IRFZ44N MOSFETs on the breadboard. Connect their gates to the two signals A and B of the oscillation section.
2. Connect the Drains:
    + Attach the drains of the MOSFETs to the primary coil of the step-up transformer.
3. Ground the Sources:
    + Connect the sources of the MOSFETs to the GND rail.
